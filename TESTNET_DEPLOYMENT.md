# Testnet Deployment Guide

## Why Deploy on Testnet First?
- **Free gas fees** - test everything without spending real money
- **Safe testing** - make sure everything works before mainnet
- **Learn the process** - get familiar with deployment steps

## Your Current Balance:
- **Arbitrum Mainnet**: 0.0006 ETH (~$1.80) 
- **Status**: Need more for mainnet deployment (~0.01 ETH needed)
