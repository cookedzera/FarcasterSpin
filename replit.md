# Overview

ArbCasino is a web-based Wheel of Fortune game designed as a Farcaster Mini App for the Arbitrum blockchain network (specifically Arbitrum Sepolia testnet). Users can spin a virtual wheel up to 5 times daily to win IARB, JUICE, and ABET tokens. The application features a complete smart contract integration with real token rewards, pending reward tracking, and a comprehensive claiming system.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Code preferences: Clean, production-ready code without testing/debug code.
Project focus: Fully Replit-compatible without external dependencies like tsx.
Navigation preferences: Fast, smooth transitions without loading animations between pages.
UI preferences: Token collection display with real balances instead of accumulated rewards on profile.
Gas fee preference: Users should pay their own gas fees for both spinning and claiming transactions, not the project wallet.
